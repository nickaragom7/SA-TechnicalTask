Scenario: A new client is onboarding with their AI agent. They want to make sure every new lead captured in their CRM gets tracked and followed up on automatically. You’ll build a basic automation to simulate this type of integration.

ACTIVITY: Set Up a Zapier Workflow

Using Zapier, create a 3-step automation that does the following:
● Trigger: A new lead is added to a CRM — you can simulate this using a Google Sheet.
● Step 1: Send an email with the lead’s details.
● Step 2: Log the lead into another Google Sheet for tracking.

2. Share Your Work
Please submit:
● A screenshot or short Loom video walking through your setup. 
● A short written explanation of how the workflow works. 
● One suggestion you’d make to improve or expand this in a real client scenario.
